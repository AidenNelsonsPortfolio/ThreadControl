Project Topic: 
    This program uses threads (UNIX) to control 5 individual threads with a self-made 
    interrupt handler/thread scheduler. This project also uses skills in MUTEX
    semaphores to ensure safe operation. 

    The project runs on an infinite loop (with console statements showing the progress through the program).

    Thanks for trying it out, I hope you enjoy!
